# AL5D-Mouse-Control
Controlling a Lynxmotion AL5D Robotic Arm using nothing but a Mouse!
This has used material from another project forom https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub once I find the exact page (or if someone suggests it) it will be added here. The project in question showcased how to send bits of information thorugh the Processing software into the Arduino and control a servo position. I have added quite a lot to the GUI and the functionality in order to control a full robotic arm using just a mouse.
The Excell file was used to generate and verify the trigonometry calculations.
